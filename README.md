## Intro

GPT4All-CLI is a robust command-line interface tool designed to harness the remarkable capabilities of GPT4All within the TypeScript ecosystem. It is constructed atop the [GPT4All-TS](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all-ts) library.

The GPT4All-TS library is a TypeScript adaptation of the GPT4All project, which provides code, data, and demonstrations based on the LLaMa large language model with approximately 800k GPT-3.5-Turbo Generations üò≤. Inspired by the [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) project, GPT4All-TS strives to extend its functionalities and make them accessible to TypeScript and JavaScript developers.

By utilizing GPT4All-CLI, developers can effortlessly tap into the power of GPT4All and LLaMa without delving into the library's intricacies. Simply install the CLI tool, and you're prepared to explore the fascinating world of large language models directly from your command line!
